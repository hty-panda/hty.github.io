I am Tianyu Han, a fourth -year Ph.D. student at China University of Mining and Technology-Beijing (CUMTB). You can also call me Tianyu. My major is Civil Engineering.  I am currently working on concrete materials and their application in drilling engineering.  I will obtain my Ph.D. degree in June 2025, with the dissertation entitled “Development and mechanical properties of solid waste lightweight high-strength concrete and feasibility study on its application in drilling engineering”, advised by Prof. Renliang Shan.

# Education Background

**Sep. 2019-Jun. 2025** 	China University of Mining and Technology-Beijing

Ph.D of  Civil Engineering. Advisor: Shan renliang
Dissertation Entitled :**Development and mechanical properties of solid waste lightweight high-strength concrete and feasibility study on its application in drilling engineering**.
 - A concrete was developed using coal gangue ceramsite aggregates as coarse aggregates. This concrete combines lightweight properties (with a oven-dry density ranging from 1942 to 2054 kg/m3), high strength (strength grades between 40 and 90 MPa), corrosion resistance, and pumpability (with a slump ranging from 140 to 220 mm).
 - The study also clarified the modification mechanism of the interface structure between the coarse aggregates and the cement matrix due to the coal gangue ceramic aggregates.
 - The feasibility and technical advantages of applying this concrete to the construction of deep wells with drilling methods for wellbore walls were explored.
